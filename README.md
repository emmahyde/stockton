# Stockton

`Stocktown "Gold" Rush` is my Stock Trading bot. He is a python kinda guy.

# Getting Started

- Go to [the Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/).
  - Download and install, reboot terminal.
  - Run `conda update -n base -c defaults conda` for good measure.
- Go to the cloned directory on your machine.
  - On Mac/Linux, execute:
    ```sh
    conda env create -f macos_linux_environment.yml
    ```
  - On PC, execute:
    ```sh
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```
- Activate the new package environment with `conda activate stockton`.
- Run `jupyter notebook` or the fancier `jupyter lab` in order to access the jupyter web interface.
